            I specialize in Amazon PPC campaign management, helping businesses
            optimize their advertising strategies for maximum profitability.
            This case study highlights my ability to analyze ad performance,
            reduce costs, and improve sales. The data showcases a 13.42% ACOS,
            ensuring an efficient ad spend while generating $247,331.87 in total
            sales from a $33,200.71 ad budget. With a CPC of $0.22, I focus on
            lowering costs while maintaining high conversion rates. The graph
            represents trends in sales, ad spend, and ACOS over time, reflecting
            seasonal variations, strategic bidding adjustments, and campaign
            optimizations. By leveraging in-depth data analysis, I help
            businesses scale their brands and maximize return on investment. If
